# Section 1: Environment Setup

## Environment Differences

From this point on, this Learning Path will be focused on using the macOS; however, Python and its installation can vary
depending on operating systems. When possible, the exercises will include the respective Windows commands, but not
necessarily always. Just note, if something isn't working or performing strange while on a different operating system,
ensure the command is correct for your system.

## Installing Python

This learning path will be using Python Version: `3.10.9`

To install, you can install with Homebrew using:

```bash
brew install python
``` 

or download directly from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Once Python is installed, you can check the version with:

```bash
python3 —version
```

__NOTE:__ This will be Different from python —version

## Virtual Environments

Out of the box Python / `pip` configuration is global on your local machine, but this might cause conflicts between
multiple Python projects on your machine. To create project specific dependencies, Python can be configured to use a
Virtual Environment to allow a project specific dependencies and versions.

#### Create new virtual environment

1. Create new directory:  `mkdir backend`

   __NOTE:__ (This learning path will use `backend` as the root directory name but this can be whatever you want)

2. Create new virtual environment `python3 -m venv .venv`

3. Activate the new virtual environment: `. .venv/bin/activate`

4. When switching projects, you can deactivate the virtual environment with  `deactivate`. To restart the virtual
   environment, just re-activate using Step 3 above.

__NOTE:__ Once the Virtual Environment has been activated, `python` can be used in place of `python3` because Python is
aware of the specific Python version used by your project.

## pip

`pip`, short for preferred installer program, is Python's package manager. This is useful for managing and installing an
application's dependencies. When working in a Virtual Environment, `pip` will install the dependencies in the `.venv`
folder to only be used with that specific project.

There are two ways to invocate `pip`, either with:

```bash
pip3 —version
```

or

```bash
python3 -m —version
```

## Install Dependencies

For this project, the following dependencies are required to build the REST API.  `Django` is the web
framework, `djangorestframework` is the framework to simplify your REST endpoint, and `pytest-django` is an extension
of `PyTest` that will simplify writing your Django tests. The command to install them all at once is:

```bash
pip install django djangorestframework pytest-django
```

A useful `pip` command is

```bash
pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
```

which will take all the installed dependencies from `pip` and copy them to the `requirements.txt` in the root of the
repository. This is standard practice within Python applications because it makes it easy to other team members to
install the necessary dependencies by using the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` using the above command.

__NOTE:__ Every time you install a new dependency, you must repopulate the `requirements.txt` file

## Testing

This series will be practicing TDD throughout all of the learning paths, so it will be critical to be able to easily
write, run, and analyze your tests. This series, as mentioned earlier, will be using `PyTest` to run and manage your
tests.

### Configuration

`PyTest` requires a `pytest.ini` file at the root of your repository. Create a new configuration file like this:

```ini
# pytest.ini
[pytest]
DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE = project.settings
python_files = tests.py test_*.py *.test.py
```

This configuration specifies where the Django project settings are and which files `PyTest` should run as tests. There
is lots more of configuration that can be put into this file, but you will not need to know or worry about that for this
series.

### Add Gitignore

If you plan on making regular commits to version control, you should have noticed that the Virtual Environment and the
necessary dependencies can be quite cumbersome, so it's best to `.gitignore` those directories. This learning path
recommends using the `.gitignore` template from [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore/api/django).

## Wrap Up:

At the end of this learning path, you should have a directory layout that resembles this:

```text
.
├── .venv
├── .gitignore
├── pytest.ini
└── requirements.txt
```

where your `requirements.txt` file resembles:

```text
asgiref==3.6.0
attrs==22.2.0
Django==4.1.6
djangorestframework==3.14.0
exceptiongroup==1.1.0
iniconfig==2.0.0
packaging==23.0
pluggy==1.0.0
pytest==7.2.1
pytest-django==4.5.2
pytz==2022.7.1
sqlparse==0.4.3
tomli==2.0.1
```
