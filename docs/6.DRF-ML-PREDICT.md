# Section 6: TDD with Django REST Framework and Machine Learning

### `/predict` Endpoint Explained

At this point, you have a REST API that performs CRUD operations on `Penguin` objects. Now, you will create a new
endpoint that only will accept `POST` requests, where the request body will be a `Penguin` object.

The endpoint will process the object, make a call to the service layer (which is a paradigm for abstracting business
logic) which predicts the species uses a machine learning model, and return a string (the Prediction!) of what type of
species the penguin is.

In this dataset, `Penguin` objects have six fields:

1. Island
2. Sex
3. Bill Length (mm)
4. Bill Depth (mm)
5. Flipper Length (mm)
6. Body Mass (g)

In machine learning, these are called `Features` (Also called `X`, `Inputs`, or `Independent Variables`). These features
will be used to predict the `Target` (Also called `Y`, `Outputs`, or `Dependendent Variable`). In this case, your target
will be a `Penguin` object's `Species`

To visualize the endpoint you will be building and the way you will interact with it is, `/predict` should look
something like this:

```text
HTTP POST /api/penguins/predict

request_body: 
  {'bill_length_mm': 39.1, 'bill_depth_mm': 18.7, 'flipper_length_mm': 181.0,
   'body_mass_g': 3750.0, 'island': 'Torgersen', 'sex': 'male'}
 
 
 Returns: 
 
    ['Adelie'] 
```

All of this is based on a dataset
from [Palmer Penguins](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/articles/intro.html) which is a dataset about the
three species of penguins from the three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. This is a publicly available
dataset, and is a great tool to learn machine learning, as well as Decision Trees.

The dataset is available as a `.csv` file from
the [GitHub](https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/blob/main/inst/extdata/penguins.csv).

In this example, you will be using one `Penguin` object of each species for the unit tests, which will simulate
predicting `Penguin` species. Furthermore, these `Penguin` objects comes from the `testing data` and allows you to use
against the model itself.

The three `Penguin` objects you will see throughout this example are:

1. Adelie Penguin

```python
{'bill_length_mm': 39.1, 'bill_depth_mm': 18.7, 'flipper_length_mm': 181.0,
 'body_mass_g': 3750.0, 'island': 'Torgersen', 'sex': 'male'}
```

2. Gentoo Penguin

```python
{'bill_length_mm': 46.1, 'bill_depth_mm': 13.2, 'flipper_length_mm': 211,
 'body_mass_g': 4500, 'island': 'Biscoe', 'sex': 'female'}
```

3. Chinstrap Penguin

```python
{'bill_length_mm': 46.5, 'bill_depth_mm': 17.9, 'flipper_length_mm': 192,
 'body_mass_g': 3500, 'island': 'Dream', 'sex': 'female'}
```

and finally, one `Penguin` object that uses dummy, fake values that are invalid. This will help you test edge cases
around serialization, HTTP Requests, and more.

4. _Invalid_ Penguin

```python
{'bill_length_mm': -5, 'bill_depth_mm': -10, 'flipper_length_mm': -15,
 'body_mass_g': -2000, 'island': 'someFakeIslandName', 'sex': 'NA'}
```

## Getting Started with `/predict`

### Install New Dependencies

As mentioned, you will be creating a more complex REST API endpoint, which utilizes to primary libraries:

1. `Pandas`
2. `Scikit Learn`
4. `Mock`

### Update `Penguin` Object

#### Create new fields

Before, you had just three properties on the `Penguin` objects (island, body_mass, and gender), but now, in order to
continue this example, you must add some more properties to the object to fully encapsulate all the attributes of a
Penguin. The new penguin object should resemble:

```python
class Penguin(models.Model):
    SEX_CHOICES = (
        ('MALE', 'male'),
        ('FEMALE', 'female'),
    )

    island = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    sex = models.CharField(max_length=6, choices=Size.choices)
    bill_length_mm = models.DecimalField(max_digits=2, decimal_places=1)
    bill_depth_mm = models.DecimalField(max_digits=2, decimal_places=1)
    flipper_length_mm = models.IntegerField(min_value=0)
    body_mass_g = models.IntegerField(min_value=0)
```

where you not only have more attributes, but also have some input validation. This input validation is used by Django
REST Framework to automatically ensure your `Penguin` object doesn't have any values it's not supposed to. For example,
the new model utilizes a `choices` parameter for `CharField()` which won't allow any inputs other than the specified
values.

#### Migrations

Due to making changes on the `Penguin` model, you will now have to inform Django REST Framework of these changes as it
is handling your database and in turn, also the migrations. For a refresher, this can be accomplished with the two
commands:

```bash
$ python manage.py makemigrations

Migrations for 'penguins':
  penguins/migrations/0002_remove_penguin_body_mass_remove_penguin_gender_and_more.py
    - Remove field body_mass from penguin
    - Remove field gender from penguin
    - Add field bill_depth_mm to penguin
    - Add field bill_length_mm to penguin
    - Add field body_mass_g to penguin
    - Add field flipper_length_mm to penguin
    - Add field sex to penguin

```

```bash
$ python manage.py migrate

Operations to perform:
  Apply all migrations: admin, auth, contenttypes, penguins, sessions
Running migrations:
  Applying penguins.0002_remove_penguin_body_mass_remove_penguin_gender_and_more... OK
```

#### Update Serializer

Finally, before you can go back to debugging and using your server, you must update the `serializer.py` file to
correctly utilize all the new attributes:

```python
class PenguinSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Penguin
        fields = ('island', 'body_mass_g', 'sex', 'bill_length_mm', 'bill_depth_mm', 'flipper_length_mm')
```

and update your test file that is creating the basic `Penguin` objects:

```python
class PenguinViewsTest(TestCase):
    @classmethod
    def setUpTestData(cls):
        Penguin.objects.create(island='fakeIsland1', body_mass_g=10, sex='female', bill_length_mm=10.0,
                               bill_depth_mm=10.0, flipper_length_mm=10)
        Penguin.objects.create(island='fakeIsland2', body_mass_g=0, sex='male', bill_length_mm=10.0,
                               bill_depth_mm=10.0, flipper_length_mm=10)
```

#### Input Validation

Also, because this will be utilizing user input, there should be some data validation on the input to ensure nothing
invalid is being passed into the endpoint. You can do this using Django REST Framework's _out-of-the-box_ validate
method on the serializer. In this example, it would look like:

```python
from rest_framework import serializers
from .models import Penguin


class PenguinSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Penguin
        fields = ('island', 'body_mass_g', 'sex', 'bill_length_mm', 'bill_depth_mm', 'flipper_length_mm')

    def validate(self, data):
        if data['bill_length_mm'] <= 0:
            raise serializers.ValidationError("Bill Length (mm) must be greater than zero")

        return data
```

Now, you want to make sure all the numbers aren't below zero (because it doesn't semantically make sense for a
weight/size to be below zero), so you can repeat the conditional like this:

```python

def validate(self, data):
    if data['bill_length_mm'] <= 0:
        raise serializers.ValidationError("Bill Length (mm) must be greater than zero")

    if data['bill_depth_mm'] <= 0:
        raise serializers.ValidationError("Bill Depth (mm) must be greater than zero")

    if data['flipper_length_mm'] <= 0:
        raise serializers.ValidationError("Flipper Length (mm) must be greater than zero")

    if data['body_mass_g'] <= 0:
        raise serializers.ValidationError("Body Mass (g) must be greater than zero")

    return data
```

### Create `POST` endpoint

#### Create a View

To start, you are going to yet again create another View which will primarily handle the `POST` on `/predict` URL. This
new view will take a `Penguin` object as an input, and will return a string output of the predicted `Penguin` species.

At this point, the `test_views.py` is getting quite long, so you can break up the tests into their respective files like
this:

```text
...
├── tests
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── test_penguinDetailsView.py
│   ├── test_penguinPredictView.py
│   └── test_penguinView.py
...
```

where the `GET` and `POST` (in the `PenguinController`) go into the `PenguinView.py`
and the `GET /{primaryKey}`, `PUT` and `DELETE` (in the `PenguinDetailController`) go into the `PenguinDetailView.py`
and finally, you will write the new `POST /predict` test in `PenguinPredictView.py`

So, you can create this new test by writing:

```python
import pytest
import mock

from django.test import TestCase
from mock.mock import Mock
from rest_framework import status
from rest_framework.exceptions import ValidationError
from rest_framework.test import APIClient

from ..serializer import PenguinSerializer
from ..service import PenguinService

client = APIClient()


class PenguinPredictViewTest(TestCase):

    @pytest.mark.django_db
    @mock.patch.object(PenguinService, 'predict', Mock(return_value=["Adelie"]))
    def test_post_predict_penguin(self):
        # call `POST` with Penguin object
        response = client.post('/api/penguins/predict/',
                               {'bill_length_mm': 39.1, 'bill_depth_mm': 18.7, 'flipper_length_mm': 181.0,
                                'body_mass_g': 3750.0, 'island': 'Torgersen', 'sex': 'male'},
                               format='json')

        assert response is not None
        assert response.status_code == status.HTTP_200_OK
        assert response.json() == "Adelie"
```

This test will create `POST` request to `/predict` with a JSON object representing a `Penguin`, and you will assert that
given a certain input, you receive a certain output back. As mentioned above, the `Penguin` object in this test is
included in the provided map of inputs to output for the trained Decision Tree model.

If you run this test, it will fail as there is not an endpoint at `api/penguin/predict` and such, your test is receiving
as `HTTP 404 NOT FOUND` error. Now that you have a failing test, you can begin to create the view in the same
file (`views.py`) as the other two existing views:

```python
from rest_framework.generics import GenericAPIView, RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView, ListCreateAPIView
from rest_framework.response import Response
from rest_framework import status
from .models import Penguin
from .serializer import PenguinSerializer


class PenguinPredictController(GenericAPIView):
    queryset = Penguin.objects.all()
    serializer_class = PenguinSerializer

    def post(self, request, format=None):
        serializer = PenguinSerializer(data=request.data)

        if serializer.is_valid():
            penguin = Penguin.objects.create(**serializer.validated_data)
            return Response("Adelie", status=status.HTTP_200_OK)

        return Response(serializer.data, status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)
```

#### Update `urls.py`

Now, even if you have a basic view like this, you still won't have a passing test until you add the
new `PenguinPredictController` to `urls.py` because Django REST Framework needs to recognize the new URL:

```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.PenguinController.as_view()),
    path('<int:pk>/', views.PenguinDetailController.as_view()),
    path('predict/', views.PenguinPredictController.as_view()),  # Here
]
```

**NOTE:**  A small thing, but something that can be quite difficult to debug is when the response you are receiving in
your unit tests have `status_code` `HTTP_301_MOVED_PERMANENTLY`. If you are finding this the case, ensure that the URL
you are using in the `client.post()` is an exact match (Ie: `/api/penguins/predict` vs `api/penguins/predict/`). If you
do not include the trailing `/`, your unit test will permanently redirect thus failing your response code assertion.

### Create `/predict` Service Layer

Now that you have a `/predict` endpoint that is tested and can return output (very similar to previous views you have
created), you can step it up a notch and start to use the machine learning model you have access to. As mentioned above,
you want to use the model to predict the species of penguin given user input. To add this complexity to your endpoint,
you can update the test to include another type of penguin:

```python
import pytest
import mock

from django.test import TestCase
from mock.mock import Mock
from rest_framework import status
from rest_framework.exceptions import ValidationError
from rest_framework.test import APIClient

from ..serializer import PenguinSerializer
from ..service import PenguinService

client = APIClient()


class PenguinPredictViewTest(TestCase):

    # [ ... 'Previous Test Case' ... ]

    @pytest.mark.django_db
    @mock.patch.object(PenguinService, 'predict', Mock(return_value=["Gentoo"]))
    def test_post_predict_penguin_gentoo(self):
        # call `POST` with Penguin object
        response = client.post('/api/penguins/predict/',
                               {'bill_length_mm': 48.2, 'bill_depth_mm': 14.3, 'flipper_length_mm': 210,
                                'body_mass_g': 4600, 'island': 'Biscoe', 'sex': 'female'},
                               format='json')

        assert response is not None
        assert response.status_code == status.HTTP_200_OK
        assert response.json() == "Gentoo"
```

This again will fail, as you are currently just returning a plain string in the response in
your `PenguinPredictController`. In order to change that, you must introduce some logic that correctly formats
the `Penguin` object, make a prediction using the model, and properly format the return value through the endpoint.
Often, in a REST API, this business logic layer is introduced in a Service Layer. To follow this pattern, you can
create two new files that will abstract the business logic away from the View/Controller layer:

1. `test/test_service.py`

```python
from django.test import TestCase

from ..models import Penguin
from ..serializer import PenguinSerializer
from ..service import predict


class ServiceTest(TestCase):

    @staticmethod
    def test_predict_penguin_adelie():
        # Create Penguin to use to predict
        serializer = PenguinSerializer(data={'bill_length_mm': 39.1, 'bill_depth_mm': 18.7, 'flipper_length_mm': 181.0,
                                             'body_mass_g': 3750.0, 'island': 'Torgersen', 'sex': 'male'})
        serializer.is_valid(raise_exception=True)
        penguin = Penguin.objects.create(**serializer.validated_data)

        # Make prediction
        prediction = predict(penguin)

        assert prediction == "Adelie"

    @staticmethod
    def test_predict_penguin_gentoo():
        # Create Penguin to use to predict
        serializer = PenguinSerializer(data={'bill_length_mm': 46.1, 'bill_depth_mm': 13.2, 'flipper_length_mm': 211,
                                             'body_mass_g': 4500.0, 'island': 'Biscoe', 'sex': 'female'})
        serializer.is_valid(raise_exception=True)
        penguin = Penguin.objects.create(**serializer.validated_data)

        # Make prediction
        prediction = predict(penguin)

        assert prediction == "Gentoo"

    @staticmethod
    def test_predict_penguin_chinstrap():
        # Create Penguin to use to predict
        serializer = PenguinSerializer(data={'bill_length_mm': 46.5, 'bill_depth_mm': 17.9, 'flipper_length_mm': 192,
                                             'body_mass_g': 3500.0, 'island': 'Dream', 'sex': 'female'})
        serializer.is_valid(raise_exception=True)
        penguin = Penguin.objects.create(**serializer.validated_data)

        # Make prediction
        prediction = predict(penguin)

        assert prediction == "Chinstrap"

```

Now this skips a portion of the TDD process, but this test includes three unit tests that create a `Penguin` object, and
directly calls the `/predict` method and asserts upon its return value.

The data you are testing comes from the provided training data above, and can be used to directly test the endpoint.

Now, these tests will fail because you haven't implemented the `service.py` file yet, so:

2. `service.py`

```python
import joblib
import pandas as pd

from penguins.models import Penguin


class PenguinService:
    def predict(penguin: Penguin) -> str:
        # Load Decision Tree Model from Joblib export
        loaded_model = joblib.load('Predict_PenguinSpecies_DecisionTree_Model.sav')

        # Create Pandas DataFrame using a formatted penguin object
        df = pd.DataFrame([penguin.formatted_data()])

        # Predict species using the model and the dataframe
        prediction = loaded_model.predict(df)

        return prediction

```

Now, you will notice that your `test_service.py` tests are passing, and you have implemented a service layer!

However, the `test_PenguinPredictController` tests are still failing. To fix this, you just need to use the service
layer in your view by just adding a few lines in your new `POST` method in `PenguinPredictController` in `views.py`:

```python
def post(self, request, format=None):
    serializer = PenguinSerializer(data=request.data)

    if serializer.is_valid():
        penguin = Penguin.objects.create(**serializer.validated_data)
        prediction = PenguinService.predict(penguin)  # <- Create Prediction

        return Response(prediction, status=status.HTTP_200_OK)  # <- Return Prediction in HTTP Response

    return Response(serializer.data, status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)
```

## Wrap Up

Finally, after 13 passing tests, you can say you have a RESTful API; you have successfully built multiple endpoints,
data persistence, and an endpoint that uses a machine learning model prediction. Also, because of the tests that you
have available as a developer, you can have an increased level of confidence to refactor and continuously improve your
code.

In the next section, you will what you have built and containerize this application, as well as use Kubernetes
to deploy said containerized application.
