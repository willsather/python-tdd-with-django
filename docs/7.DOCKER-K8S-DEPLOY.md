## Docker
* Create Dockerfile
* Run locally with application in docker container
* Can even publish container to a registry

# Alternative: Use buildpacks???
# cloud native packs
* note: ARM vs AMD (is it worth doing this vs just docker-compose?)
```bash
homebrew install **//pack
```

[Buildpack docs](https://buildpacks.io/docs/app-developer-guide/build-an-app/)
