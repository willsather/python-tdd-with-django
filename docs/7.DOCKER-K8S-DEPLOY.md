# Section 6: Deploy Python Application using Docker and Kubernetes

## Option 1: Docker

To create a Docker image, you will need to create both a `Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
# The first instruction is what image we want to base our container on
# We Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:latest

# The enviroment variable ensures that the python output is set straight
# to the terminal with out buffering it first
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED 1

# create root directory for our project in the container
RUN mkdir /backend

# Set the working directory to /music_service
WORKDIR /backend

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /music_service
ADD . /backend/

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```dockerfile
version: '3'

services:
  web:
    build: .
    command: bash -c "python manage.py makemigrations && python manage.py migrate && python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000"
    container_name: backend
    volumes:
      - .:/backend
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
```

To run this image locally (with the application in a docker container):

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 penguins-predict
```

which will map port `8080` on the container to port `8080` on your local machine. Given this, you will now be able to
use the `penguin` endpoint just like you were before, but instead of running it with Python, you can run the image you
have created.

Furthermore, you could also extend this and publish the image to a registry, like the one hosted
on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/).

# Option 2: Buildpacks

Cloud Native Buildpacks allow you to easily create production ready images that come bundle with other _out-of-the-box
feature_. If you were to just use a `docker-compose.yml` file, you would be missing out on both the simplicity of
Buildpacks and features listed [here](https://buildpacks.io/features/).

```bash
homebrew install buildpacks/tap/pack
```

Using [Paketo Buildpacks](https://paketo.io/):

```bash
pack build penguins-predict --builder paketobuildpacks/builder:base
```

## Kubernetes

* This is currently TBD, investigating what `yml` is required to make this all happen, plus determining if this is even
  relevant or worthwhile.

Topics of consideration: 
* Deployment manifest / yml
* Configuration
* Persistence / storage
* How dependent is this
