## Section 3: TDD for Django Rest Framework GET Endpoint


## Create your first endpoint

As you progress through this learning path, you will be writing tests first and then the implementation.  You will use your tests to validate that what your building is working as intended.

### Create First Test
Start by creating a `/tests` folder and inside your first test file called `test_views.py` in your `penguins` application.  You can also delete the `tests.py` file that Django generated when you created the application.  Now, the application structure should look like:

```text
.
├── penguins
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── ...
│   ├── tests
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   └── test_views.py
│   ├── urls.py
│   └── views.py
├── manage.py
├── project
│   └── ...
├── pytest.ini
└── requirements.txt
```

and your first test (that is testing the view you will be creating) should be:

```python
import pytest
from django.test import TestCase
from rest_framework.test import APIClient
from rest_framework import status

client = APIClient()

class PenguinViewTest(TestCase):

    @pytest.mark.django_db
    def test_get_all_penguins(self):
        response = client.get('api/penguin/', format='json')
        
        assert response != None
        assert response.status_code == status.HTTP_200_OK
```

### Run Tests
To run your tests, run:
```bash
pytest
```

When you run this test, it will fail because the response is undefined, thus failing the first assert statement.  This is because you haven't defined the `GET` endpoint yet.  you should get a 404 error.  

**NOTE:** This test will fail until you build your view, do not worry yet!

```python
        assert response != None
>       assert response.status_code == status.HTTP_200_OK
E       assert 404 == 200
E        +  where 404 = <HttpResponseNotFound status_code=404, "text/html; charset=utf-8">.status_code
E        +  and   200 = status.HTTP_200_OK
```

### Create a View

To get this test to pass, you need to actually implement the view now.  However, you will not be able to build out the view without some of the critical components of a Django application: `Model` and `Serializer`.  
In `views.py`:

```python
from rest_framework.generics import GenericAPIView
from rest_framework.response import Response

class PenguinController(GenericAPIView):

    def get(self, request, format=None):
        return Response()
```

And update your `urls.py` to include the new view:

```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.PenguinController.as_view()),
]
```

Test Passes!
```
============================== 1 passed in 0.26s ==============================
```

Now that you have a passing test, to continue with TDD you will continue to use the methodology "RED", "GREEN", "REFACTOR".  So, let's write a failing test (or modify existing test to fail).  Given that now you want to actually return relevant data through the endpoint, you need to first create the relevant object and serializers.



#### Create a Model
In the `models.py` file, you can create a Penguin model which will hold what island the penguin is from, what its body mass is, and finally what gender it is:

```python
from django.db import models

class Penguin(models.Model):
    island = models.CharField()
    body_mass = models.IntegerField()
    gender = models.CharField()
```

Then, you must 'register' your model in the application's `admin.py` file in your application:

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import Penguin

# Register your models here.
admin.site.register(Penguin)
```

#### Creating a Serializer
As mentioned in the last section, serializers is what allows your application to send or receive `json`, `XML`, or other data structures through the REST endpoint.  Serializers often live in the `serializer.py` file and the one you are building below will tell your application two primary pieces of information:

1. What model type to serialize
2. What model fields to serialize

```python
from rest_framework import serializer
from .models import Date, Penguin


class PenguinSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Penguin
        fields = ('island', 'body_mass', 'gender')
```

As you can tell, this is a pretty concise implementation of a serializer.  At the end of the day, using Django REST Framework's `serializers.ModelSerializer` generic class save a lot of time and complexity.


### Create a Database Migration
Now that you have created a `model.py` and a `serializer.py` and Because Django is a Full Stack Web Framework, Django comes pre-configured with a database (Default is a local copy of SQLite) that will perform [CRUD operations]() with your new `Penguin` model.  Out of the box, Django will require you to perform a database migration every time you change your model. So if you add a property, remove a property, or change a property on a model, you must run two commands:

1. Create the necessary migrations
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
```

2. Actually migrate the database
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

Because of the new `Penguin` model, you will have to run both of these commands!

The first command should output:

```text
Migrations for 'penguins':
  penguins/migrations/0001_initial.py
    - Create model Penguin
```

and the second, should output:

```text
Operations to perform:
  Apply all migrations: admin, auth, contenttypes, penguins, sessions
Running migrations:
  [ ... ]
  Applying penguins.0001_initial... OK
  Applying sessions.0001_initial... OK
```

where the `[ ... ]` is the out of the box migrations for Django.

You don't need to truly understand what is going on for the migrations for the Django configuration, but to learn more you can visit [Django Migrations](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/migrations/).  


### Update the View
Finally, after creating the model and the serializer, you can put all of the pieces together in the `views.py`.  First, update your `test_views.py` to create two fake `Penguin` objects and assert that the `GET` response matches the correct `Penguin` objects:

```python
import pytest
from django.test import TestCase
from rest_framework.test import APIClient
from rest_framework import status
from ..models import Penguin
from ..serializer import PenguinSerializer

client = APIClient()

class PenguinViewTest(TestCase):

    @classmethod
    def setUpTestData(cls):
        # Create two fake penguins
        Penguin.objects.create(
            island='fakeIslandName', body_mass=100, gender='female')
        Penguin.objects.create(
            island='fakeIslandName', body_mass=200, gender='male')

    @pytest.mark.django_db
    def test_get_all_penguins(self):
        # All penguins
        all_penguins = Penguin.objects.all()
        expected_data = PenguinSerializer(all_penguins, many=True).data

        # Make GET call to endpoint
        response = client.get('/api/penguins/', format='json')
        
        # Assert response is successful and matches all penguin data
        assert response != None
        assert response.status_code == status.HTTP_200_OK
        assert response.json() == expected_data
```

This test fails because you are currently returning an empty `Response`, to change that, modify `views.py` to:

```python
from rest_framework.generics import GenericAPIView
from rest_framework.response import Response
from .models import Penguin
from .serializer import PenguinSerializer

class PenguinController(GenericAPIView):
    queryset = Penguin.objects.all()

    def get(self, request, format=None):
        penguins = Penguin.objects.all()
        serializer = PenguinSerializer(penguins, many=True)
        return Response(serializer.data)
```

This view's `get()` method is now querying all of the saved `Penguin` objects available, serializing the `Penguin` objects into `json` data (the `many=True` tag specifies to the serializer that you are serializing multiple objects), and finally returning an HTTP Response containing the `Penguin` objects.

**NOTE:** `queryset` is required by `GenericAPIView` from Django REST Framework to actually run in the browser.  

### Running your test
Oof.  That's a lot of little pieces coming together, but now that you have the `model.py`, `serializer.py`, and the `views.py` built out, you can finally run your test to ensure that the `GET` API call succeeds with a `HTTP 200 OK`


```bash
pytest
```

Should output:

```
penguins/tests/test_views.py .                                           [100%]

============================== 1 passed in 0.29s ==============================
