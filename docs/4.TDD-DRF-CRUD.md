## Section 4: TDD for Django Rest Framework CRUD Application


## Debug your REST Endpoint

From the previous section, you have created a very basic that returns the `Penguin` objects available in the database, and your tests even return two fake `Penguin` objects.  However, when you run:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

and navigate to `localhost:8000/api/penguins`, you can see the `Penguin Controller` endpoint and this:

```
GET /api/penguins/
--- 
HTTP 200 OK
Allow: GET, HEAD, OPTIONS
Content-Type: application/json
Vary: Accept

[]
```

## Create `POST` endpoint
Under your `penguins` application and in `test_views.py`, the next step is to create a test that simulates a `POST` call to the API.  For brevity, this learning path will not necessarily type line by line in the overall TDD "Red, Green, Refactor" process; however, it is recommended as you follow along to work incrementally and experiment with what makes your test `PASS` and `FAIL`.  

The new test for `POST` will look something like in your `test_views.py` test class: 

```python
@pytest.mark.django_db
def test_post_new_penguins(self):
    # Assert two penguins already exist
    penguins = Penguin.objects.all()
    assert penguins.count() == 2

    # call `POST` with new Penguin object
    post_response = client.post('/api/penguins/', {'island': 'fakeIslandName', 'body_mass': 300, 'gender': 'N/A'}, format='json')
    assert post_response != None
    assert post_response.status_code == status.HTTP_201_CREATED

    # `GET` all penguins from server
    get_response = client.get('/api/penguins/', format='json')

    # Get all penguins using REST endpoint and prepare
    dates = Penguin.objects.all()
    serializer = PenguinSerializer(dates, many=True)
    
    # Assert response is successful and new penguin data is created
    assert get_response.json() == serializer.data
    assert get_response.status_code == status.HTTP_200_OK
```

Not that you have a failing test, to implement the `POST` endpoint, in your `views.py` `PenguinController` you can write:

```python
def post(self, request, format=None):
    serializer = PenguinSerializer(data=request.data)

    if serializer.is_valid():
        serializer.save()
        return Response(serializer.data, status=status.HTTP_201_CREATED)
    
    return Response(serializer.data, status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)
```

```
penguins/tests/test_views.py .                                           [100%]

============================== 1 passed in 0.29s ==============================
```

And just like that, the test passes.

**NOTE:** To debug locally by running your server (using `python manage.py runserver`), you must add the `serializer_class` attribute on the `PenguinController` similarly how you added the `queryset` during the `GET` endpoint.  Like this:

```python
class PenguinController(GenericAPIView):
    queryset = Penguin.objects.all()
    serializer_class = PenguinSerializer

    [...]
```

## Finishing CRUD Operations
At this point, you now have an endpoint that can `GET` `Penguin` objects, and `POST` `Penguin` objects (The `Retrieve` and `Create` in CRUD), but now you need to implement the `Update` and `Delete` aspects of the endpoint. 

However, your application is at a point where you would now need to create a new view for `Penguin Detail` that would look something like this when calling it from a URL: `/api/penguin/1` where `pk` is `1` which is how you retrieve, update, and delete a single instance of a `Penguin` object.

What this will lead to is creating more boilerplate methods like 

1. `def get(self, request, pk, format=None)`
2. `delete(self, request, pk, format=None)`
3. `def put(self, request, pk, format=None)` 
   
in a new view called `PenguinDetailController`

Rather than manually create another Class Based View, you can used a Django REST Framework generic that is similar to `GenericAPIView`, but provides much more "out-of-the-box" functionality.  So, to create the tests first (of course), you can write:

```python
@pytest.mark.django_db
    def test_delete_penguin(self):
        # Assert two penguins already exist
        penguins = Penguin.objects.all()
        assert penguins.count() == 2

        # call `POST` with new Penguin object
        response = client.delete('/api/penguins/1/', format='json')
        assert response.status_code == status.HTTP_204_NO_CONTENT

        # Assert only 1 penguin exists now
        assert Penguin.objects.all().count() == 1        
        
    @pytest.mark.django_db
    def test_get_specific_penguin(self):
        primary_key = 1
        penguin = Penguin.objects.get(pk=primary_key)
        expected_data = PenguinSerializer(penguin).data

        # call `GET` with primary key
        response = client.get(f'/api/penguins/{primary_key}/', format='json')
        assert response.status_code == status.HTTP_200_OK

        # Assert penguins are equal
        assert response != None
        assert response.status_code == status.HTTP_200_OK
        assert response.json() == expected_data

    @pytest.mark.django_db
    def test_update_penguin(self):
        primary_key = 2
        new_penguin = {'island': 'fakeIslandName', 'body_mass': 300, 'gender': 'N/A'}
        expected_data = PenguinSerializer(new_penguin).data

        # call `PUT` with new Penguin object
        response = client.put(f'/api/penguins/{primary_key}/', new_penguin, format='json')

        # Assert response is successful and penguin data is updated
        assert response != None
        assert response.status_code == status.HTTP_200_OK
        assert response.json() == expected_data
```

Not that you have three failing tests, you can create your new view quite quickly in `views.py` `PenguinDetailsController` like this:

```python
from rest_framework.generics import GenericAPIView, RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView

class PenguinController(GenericAPIView):
  [ ... ]

class PenguinDetailController(RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView):
    queryset = Penguin.objects.all()
    serializer_class = PenguinSerializer
```

```
penguins/tests/test_views.py .                                           [100%]

============================== 5 passed in 0.17s ==============================
```

Wow, all of those tests pass that easy?!  Using Django REST Framework's provided generic API views, it gives you the ability to quickly create RESTful views using "out of the box" functionality.  CRUD endpoints are quite common and thus, Django REST Framework have made a variety of Views, like the one you are using now: `RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView`.

## Django REST Framework Generics
As you can see, we have tested and implemented two different Views in `views.py`:

| View      | `Penguin` Object | `HTTP` Requests | Django REST Framework Generic |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| PenguinController | All `Penguin` objects | `GET`, `POST` | GenericAPIView
| PenguinDetailsController | Single `Penguin` object | `GET`, `PUT`, `DELETE` | RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView


### Refactoring

Now that we have completed both types of views, it is worth mentioning the __why__ you did it this way.  For starters, `PenguinController` is a more manual implementation allowing you to better understand how Django is working under the hood.  However, once you understand that, one of the primary benefits of using Django REST Framework is the simplicity and abstraction from the REST implementation.  This allows you to worry less about the "How REST" and more about what you are actually building.  

Up until this point, we have been doing TDD through writing a failing test, then changing the implementation to get the test to pass.  Now, a critical piece of TDD is refactoring.  As the saying goes: "Red, Green, Refactor".  Now that you have some test written that test the behavior of your API, you can change the implementation or refactor; and by running your tests will give you the confidence that the application still performs the same as before!

As mentioned right above, the `PenguinController` is a more manual implementation of a view.  For explanatory purpose, you can actually refactor that view now to also use a Django REST Framework generic that simplifies your code quite drastically.  To demonstrate, look at the differences between the two views that are doing exactly the same thing:

#### GenericAPIView
```python
from rest_framework.generics import GenericAPIView
from rest_framework.response import Response
from rest_framework import status
from .models import Penguin
from .serializer import PenguinSerializer

class PenguinController(GenericAPIView):
    queryset = Penguin.objects.all()
    serializer_class = PenguinSerializer

    def get(self, request, format=None):
        penguins = Penguin.objects.all()
        serializer = PenguinSerializer(penguins, many=True)
        return Response(serializer.data)
    
    def post(self, request, format=None):
        serializer = PenguinSerializer(data=request.data)

        if serializer.is_valid():
            serializer.save()
            return Response(serializer.data, status=status.HTTP_201_CREATED)
        
        return Response(serializer.data, status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)
```

#### RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView
```python
from rest_framework.generics import ListCreateAPIView
from .models import Penguin
from .serializer import PenguinSerializer

class PenguinController(ListCreateAPIView):
    queryset = Penguin.objects.all()
    serializer_class = PenguinSerializer
```

and they do the exact same thing! Don't believe it, run your tests!

From this point on, this learning path will be using the condensed `PenguinController` to save space and for less complexity.  

## Wrap Up
At the end of this learning path, you have now built a basic CRUD application using Django / Django REST Framework all why using TDD.  Using TDD allows you to refactor and make new changes while still validating it hasn't broken other parts of you code.  

This CRUD application is able to perform `HTTP requests` and provides `HTTP Responses` all in regards to the `Penguin` object.  For example, if you make a few `POST` requests with new `Penguin` objects, that data will persist in the pre-configured database from Django.
